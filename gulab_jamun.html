		<h3>Gulab Jamun</h3>
		<p>
<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Gulab Jamun:</p>
<p>- 1 cup of Gulab Jamun mix (readily available in stores)</p>
<p>- A few tablespoons of milk (as needed)</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Sugar Syrup:</p>
<p>- 1 1/2 cups of sugar</p>
<p>- 1 cup of water</p>
<p>- A few drops of rose water (optional)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Make the sugar syrup by combining sugar and water in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil and simmer for 5-7 minutes until it reaches a one-string consistency. Add a few drops of rose water if you like and set it aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In a mixing bowl, add the Gulab Jamun mix.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Gradually add a few tablespoons of milk to the mix and knead it into a soft dough. Be careful not to make it too sticky or too dry. The dough should be smooth and pliable.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Divide the dough into small, even-sized portions and roll them into smooth balls. Ensure there are no cracks on the surface. Keep them covered to prevent drying out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Heat ghee or oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. The temperature should be around 350°F (175°C).</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Carefully slide a few dough balls into the hot oil and fry them until they turn golden brown. Make sure to maintain the oil at a consistent temperature to ensure even cooking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Once the Gulab Jamun balls are golden brown, remove them from the oil and drain on a paper towel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. While they are still warm, place the fried Gulab Jamun into the prepared sugar syrup. Allow them to soak in the syrup for a few hours or until they become soft and spongy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature. They are a delightful and sweet treat enjoyed on various occasions.</p>
