		<h3>Samosa</h3>
		
<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Samosa Filling:</p>
<p>- 2 cups of boiled and mashed potatoes</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup of boiled and chopped mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, and green beans)</p>
<p>- 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds</p>
<p>- 1 teaspoon of ginger-garlic paste</p>
<p>- 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric powder</p>
<p>- 1 teaspoon of coriander powder</p>
<p>- 1 teaspoon of garam masala</p>
<p>- Salt to taste</p>
<p>- 2 tablespoons of oil</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Samosa Dough:</p>
<p>- 2 cups of all-purpose flour</p>
<p>- 1/4 cup of oil or ghee</p>
<p>- Water for kneading</p>
<p>- Salt to taste</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Start by making the samosa dough. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and oil (or ghee). Mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add water and knead it into a smooth, stiff dough. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. While the dough is resting, prepare the samosa filling. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan. Add cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add ginger-garlic paste and saut√© for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Add turmeric, coriander powder, and garam masala. Stir well.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Add the boiled and mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables. Mix everything together and cook for a few minutes. Season with salt to taste. The filling should be well-spiced and dry. Set it aside to cool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Divide the rested dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a ball. Roll out each ball into a thin oval or circle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Cut the rolled-out dough in half to form two semi-circles.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Take one semi-circle, fold it in half to form a cone shape, and seal the edges with a little water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Fill the cone with the prepared potato and vegetable mixture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Seal the open edge of the cone to form a triangular samosa. Press the edges firmly to ensure they are sealed properly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. To check if the oil is ready for frying, drop a small piece of dough into it; it should sizzle and rise to the surface.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Carefully slide the samosas into the hot oil and fry them until they turn golden brown and crispy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13. Remove the fried samosas and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your delicious homemade samosas are ready to be served. Enjoy them with mint chutney or tamarind sauce.</p>
