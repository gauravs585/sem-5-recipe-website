		<h3>Chocolate Pastry</h3>

<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Pastry Dough:</p>
<p>- 1 sheet of puff pastry (store-bought or homemade)</p>
<p>- All-purpose flour for dusting</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Chocolate Filling:</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips or chopped chocolate</p>
<p>- 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</p>
<p>- 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar</p>
<p>- 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract</p>
<p>- 1 egg (for egg wash)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Thaw the puff pastry sheet according to the package instructions if you're using store-bought pastry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the chocolate chips and butter together in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until the mixture is smooth and well combined.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Stir in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract into the melted chocolate-butter mixture. Set it aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Roll out the puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface into a rectangle. If the pastry sheet has creases, smooth them out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Cut the pastry into smaller rectangles or squares, depending on your preference. You can make large pastries or smaller, bite-sized ones.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Place a spoonful of the chocolate filling in the center of each pastry square or rectangle.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Beat the egg to create an egg wash and lightly brush the edges of the pastry with it. This will help seal the pastry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Fold the pastry over the chocolate filling to create a triangle or rectangle shape, ensuring the edges are sealed. You can use a fork to press down on the edges to secure the seal.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Place the chocolate pastries on the prepared baking sheet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Brush the tops of the pastries with the remaining egg wash for a shiny finish.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until the pastries are golden brown and puffed up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13. Remove the chocolate pastries from the oven and let them cool slightly on a wire rack.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your simple and delicious chocolate pastries are ready to be enjoyed. You can dust them with powdered sugar or drizzle with melted chocolate for an extra touch of sweetness, if desired.</p>
