		<h3>Tacos</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Taco Filling:</p>
<p>- 1 pound ground beef (or ground chicken, turkey, or a meat substitute)</p>
<p>- 1 packet of taco seasoning mix (or use homemade taco seasoning)</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup diced onions</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup diced tomatoes</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup shredded lettuce</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup grated cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese</p>
<p>- 1/4 cup sour cream</p>
<p>- 1/4 cup salsa</p>
<p>- 8 small taco shells or tortillas</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. In a skillet, cook the ground meat over medium-high heat until it's browned and fully cooked, breaking it into smaller pieces as it cooks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Drain any excess fat from the cooked meat and return it to the skillet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add the diced onions and taco seasoning mix to the cooked meat. Follow the instructions on the seasoning packet for the right amount of water or simply add about 1/2 cup of water. Stir well and simmer for a few minutes until the mixture thickens and the flavors meld together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. While the taco filling is simmering, warm the taco shells or tortillas according to the package instructions, or you can heat them in a dry skillet for a few seconds on each side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. To assemble the tacos, place a spoonful of the seasoned meat mixture into each taco shell.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Top the meat with diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, grated cheese, sour cream, and salsa, or any other toppings you prefer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Serve the tacos immediately while they are hot and enjoy!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Feel free to customize your tacos with your favorite toppings such as guacamole, chopped cilantro, jalape√±os, or hot sauce. This basic taco recipe is versatile and can be adapted to your taste.</p>
