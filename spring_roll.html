		<h3>Spring roll</h3>
<p>Here's a short and simple recipe for making spring rolls:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Filling:</p>
<p>- 1 cup thinly sliced cabbage</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup julienned carrots</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup thinly sliced bell peppers (red, green, or yellow)</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup bean sprouts</p>
<p>- 2-3 green onions, thinly sliced</p>
<p>- 1 cup cooked and shredded chicken, tofu, or your choice of protein (optional)</p>
<p>- 2 cloves garlic, minced</p>
<p>- 1 tablespoon soy sauce</p>
<p>- 1 tablespoon sesame oil</p>
<p>- Salt and pepper to taste</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Spring Roll Wrappers:</p>
<p>- 8-10 spring roll wrappers (rice paper sheets)</p>
<p>- Warm water for soaking the wrappers</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. In a large bowl, combine the sliced cabbage, julienned carrots, sliced bell peppers, bean sprouts, and green onions. Add the cooked and shredded protein (if using) to the mixture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In a small bowl, mix together the minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Pour the soy sauce mixture over the vegetable and protein mixture. Toss everything together until well combined.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. To prepare the spring roll wrappers, fill a shallow dish or a large plate with warm water. Dip one spring roll wrapper into the water for about 5-10 seconds until it softens. Place it on a clean, damp cloth or paper towel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Spoon a portion of the vegetable and protein mixture onto the softened wrapper. Fold the sides of the wrapper over the filling, and then fold the bottom over the filling. Roll it up tightly, similar to a burrito.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and filling.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Serve the spring rolls immediately, or you can serve them with a dipping sauce of your choice, such as sweet chili sauce, soy sauce, or peanut sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These homemade spring rolls are fresh and delicious. You can easily customize the filling to suit your preferences, making them a versatile and tasty snack or appetizer.</p>
