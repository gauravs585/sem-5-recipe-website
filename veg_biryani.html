		<h3>Veg Biryani</h3>
	
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- 1 cup Basmati rice</p>
<p>- 2 cups mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, beans)</p>
<p>- 1 large onion, thinly sliced</p>
<p>- 2 tomatoes, chopped</p>
<p>- 2 cloves of garlic, minced</p>
<p>- 1-inch piece of ginger, grated</p>
<p>- 2 tablespoons biryani masala</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup plain yogurt</p>
<p>- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee (clarified butter)</p>
<p>- Salt, to taste</p>
<p>- Fresh coriander leaves and fried onions for garnish (optional)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Wash the Basmati rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove some for garnish, if desired.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot and sauté for a minute or until the raw smell disappears.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to separate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Stir in the biryani masala and cook for a few minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Add the mixed vegetables and sauté briefly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Mix in the yogurt and salt, and cook for a couple of minutes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Add the drained rice and stir to combine with the vegetables and spices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Pour in 2 cups of water and bring the mixture to a boil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. You can also use a rice cooker for this step.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Once the biryani is ready, fluff the rice with a fork and garnish with fresh coriander leaves and fried onions, if desired.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Serve your vegetable biryani hot, either on its own or with raita (yogurt with spices) on the side.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Enjoy your homemade vegetable biryani!</p>
