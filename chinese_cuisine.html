		<h3>Chinese Cuisine</h3>
<p>Chinese cuisine is celebrated for its diverse regional flavors, five essential taste elements (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, and salty), and an array of ingredients, including rice, noodles, meats, and vegetables. Cooking techniques like stir-frying, steaming, and deep-frying preserve the natural textures and flavors of the ingredients. Iconic dishes like Peking duck and dim sum showcase the culinary artistry of China. The cuisine has deep cultural significance, symbolizing prosperity and harmony. Street food culture and a rich tradition of tea add to the culinary tapestry, making Chinese cuisine a global favorite.</p>
