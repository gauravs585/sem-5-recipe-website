		<h3>Cheese Nuggets</h3>
		<p>Here's a short and simple recipe for making cheese nuggets:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p></p>
<p>- 1 cup of cheese cubes (cheddar, mozzarella, or your preferred cheese)</p>
<p>- 1 cup breadcrumbs</p>
<p>- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour</p>
<p>- 2 eggs, beaten</p>
<p>- 1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
<p>- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper</p>
<p>- Oil for frying</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Start by preparing a breading station. In one bowl, place the all-purpose flour. In another bowl, add the beaten eggs. In a third bowl, combine the breadcrumbs with salt and black pepper.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2. Take a cheese cube and dip it into the flour, making sure it's coated evenly. </p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Next, dip the floured cheese cube into the beaten eggs, ensuring it's well-covered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Roll the cheese cube in the breadcrumb mixture, pressing gently to help the breadcrumbs adhere.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for a second coating by dipping the cheese cube back into the egg and breadcrumbs. This double coating ensures the cheese stays inside when frying.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Place the breaded cheese nugget on a tray or plate and repeat the process for the remaining cheese cubes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat to about 350°F (175°C).</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Carefully add a few cheese nuggets to the hot oil and fry them until they turn golden brown, which should only take a minute or two.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Using a slotted spoon, remove the cheese nuggets from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Serve the cheese nuggets hot, perhaps with a dipping sauce like ketchup, ranch dressing, or marinara sauce.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These cheese nuggets make a delightful and cheesy snack or appetizer. They're sure to be a hit with cheese lovers of all ages.</p>
